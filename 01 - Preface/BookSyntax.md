# Book Syntax
In this book I'll use various title headers to make it simple for students to not get diverted and focus on the part they want to learn and enhance.

>> Bold text with square brackets [], headings for absolutely important concepts. Like this one:
[**Important topic**]

>> Bold, with curly braces {}, headings for examples. You may red these for more in depth knowledge. Like this one:
{**Examples**}

>> Double opposite Angle brackets if you are bored and want to try some cool stuff. Skip this if you are in a hurry or just not interested. This is not in syllabus but it's always good to know more to brag about it to your friends. ;)
Like the one below:
\>>**Let's have some fun**<<
