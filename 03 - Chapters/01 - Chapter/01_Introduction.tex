We will begin with axes definition. The line on a graph that runs horizontally (left-right) through zero is called as the X axis. It is used as a reference line so you can measure from it. The X axis goes from $(-\infty, \infty)$. As you go left the value decreases and as you go right the value increases.\\

The line on a graph that runs vertically (top-bottom) through zero is called as the Y axis. The Y axis also goes from $(-\infty, \infty)$. As you go bottom the value decreases and as you go top the value increases.
