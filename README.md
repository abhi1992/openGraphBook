# Open Graph Book

Open Graph book is an open source book for students to learn maths using graphs in a fun way. The reason for creating such a book is to provide students good quality education while having fun. The softcopy of the book is going to be free of cost. If you are a student or know someone who is please tell them that this book does exist. And it can help them learn graphs and maths easily.

### Tech

I will be using a bunch of already available softwares for demos. But you can either follow them or use your own software or completely ignore it.
